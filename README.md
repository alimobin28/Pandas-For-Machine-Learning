# 📊 Pandas for Machine Learning – Step-by-Step Practice Roadmap
Welcome to the Pandas for ML practice repository!

This repo provides a structured and hands-on roadmap (with numbered topics) to help you master Pandas, one of the most essential Python libraries for Machine Learning and Data Science. Whether you're just starting out or brushing up your skills, this roadmap will guide you through everything you need — from loading data to feature engineering and visualization.

🧭 Roadmap Overview
Below is the recommended learning path (1–27) broken into key stages:

🔹 1–24: Data Handling & Cleaning
Master the art of loading, cleaning, and manipulating data in Pandas — the foundation of all ML projects.

Step	Topic
✅ 1	Pandas – Introduction & Features
✅ 2	Install & Setup Pandas
✅ 3	Create a Pandas DataFrame
✅ 4	Pandas DataFrames – Attributes & Methods
✅ 12	Read CSV in Pandas
✅ 13	Read Excel in Pandas
✅ 14	Indexing in Pandas
✅ 15	Select Multiple Columns in Pandas
✅ 16	Add a New Column in Pandas
✅ 17	Delete Rows/Columns in Pandas
✅ 18	Iterate Over Rows and Columns
✅ 20	Handle Duplicates
✅ 21	Clean the Data
✅ 24	Remove Whitespace

#⚙️ 10–26: Feature Engineering with Pandas
Learn how to transform and enrich your data for better ML performance.

  Step  Topic
✅ 10 	Categorical Data in Pandas
✅ 11	  Working with Categories
✅ 22	  String Operations
✅ 23	  Date Time Operations
✅ 25	  Group the Data
✅ 26	  Statistical Functions

📊 19 & 27: Data Exploration & Visualization
Basic EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is key to understanding your data before modeling.

Step	Topic
✅ 19	Sorting in Pandas
✅ 27	Plot a DataFrame

❌ Topics You Can Skip (Optional for ML Use)
